# Algorithms 4 everyone!

This repository is a big container for various types of algorithms. 
Sadly, it is a little bit poor - it needs **you** to be improved!

### Installation

If you have git:
```sh
$ mkdir Algorithms
$ cd Algorithms
$ git clone https://github.com/imaprincess/Algorithms-4-everyone
```

If you don't have git download the zip [here](https://github.com/imaprincess/Algorithms-4-everyone/archive/master.zip)

### How to help

- Look at the [issues](https://github.com/imaprincess/Algorithms-4-everyone/issues): if you find something that you can do, answer the issue and make this repo grow! **Remember**: all the code will be reviewed by me and accepted only if the code follows the rules specified in every issue. **Don't do pull requests if you know that your code doesn't follow all the rules!**
- If you have some algorithms that you'd like to insert in the repo I suggest you to open an issue (so I can give you some advices), but you can directly open a pull request.
